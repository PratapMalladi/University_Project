## Business problem :- Students' Performance and Employability Prediction through Data Mining.

### University dropout is a problem which affects universities around the world, with consequences such as reduced enrolment, reduced revenue for the university, and financial losses for the State which funds the studies, and also constitutes a social problem for students, their families, and society in general.

### Hence the importance of predicting university dropout, that is to say identify dropout students in advance, in order to design strategies to tackle this problem.

Code Can't be disclosed as part of the legalities involved, only high level presentation is shared and available research papers on the Business problem context because I feel working in data science and machine learning is an exciting and challenging field. New techniques and tools are constantly percolating and honestly, it can feel overwhelming. Many of these new developments are found and first revealed in academic research articles. Extracting knowledge from these articles is difficult because the intended audience of these papers tend to be other researchers. Yet in order to stay current reading papers is an essential skill â€” luckily one that can be improved with diligence and practice.
